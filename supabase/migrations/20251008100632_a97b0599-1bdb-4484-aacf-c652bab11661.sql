-- COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY FIX
-- Fix all identified security vulnerabilities

-- ============================================
-- 1. Fix workspace_member_view grants (CRITICAL)
-- ============================================

-- Ensure view exists with proper security
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.workspace_member_view CASCADE;

CREATE VIEW public.workspace_member_view 
WITH (security_invoker = true, security_barrier = true)
AS
SELECT 
  w.id,
  w.name,
  w.owner_id,
  w.created_at,
  w.updated_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN w.owner_id = auth.uid() THEN w.invite_code
    ELSE NULL
  END as invite_code
FROM public.workspaces w
WHERE public.is_workspace_member(w.id, auth.uid());

-- Revoke all access then grant explicitly
REVOKE ALL ON public.workspace_member_view FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON public.workspace_member_view FROM anon;
REVOKE ALL ON public.workspace_member_view FROM authenticated;

-- Grant SELECT only to authenticated users
GRANT SELECT ON public.workspace_member_view TO authenticated;

COMMENT ON VIEW public.workspace_member_view IS 
'SECURITY: Restricted to authenticated users only. Filters by workspace membership and hides invite codes from non-owners.';

-- 2. Add explicit authentication requirements to all tables
